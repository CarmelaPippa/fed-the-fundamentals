            Hi, I'm Carmela, born in '91. Grew up in Naples, southern Italy,
            with a passion for crochet and a great support for my favorite team.
            <br /><br />
            I has always been an animal lover and this is why I appreciate
            emotional expression and sensitivity, I give priority to empathy,
            social harmony and cooperation. <br />
            <br />Always ready to explore and experience something new. I am
            pragmatic and down to earth, with a strong focus on what is
            happening or is very likely to happen.

            My Windows '98 computer holds a special place in my memories, as it
            marked the beginning of my digital journey and taught me valuable
            problem-solving skills. Back in those days, owning a Windows '98
            computer was an exciting experience for me.
            <br />
            Computers of that era weren't as stable as modern ones, and they
            often encountered issues. I quickly discovered that calling a
            technician could be costly, so I took matters into my own hands.
            Watching those technicians work became a valuable learning
            experience for me. I observed their every move, trying to grasp the
            intricacies of the machine. Over time, I became more confident and
            adept at solving issues myself. This newfound skill not only saved
            me money but also empowered me to navigate the digital world with
            greater ease.
