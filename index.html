              Hi, I'm Carmela, born in '91. Grew up in Naples, southern Italy,
              with a passion for crochet and a great support for my favorite
              team. <br /><br />
              I has always been an animal lover and this is why I appreciate
              emotional expression and sensitivity, I give priority to empathy,
              social harmony and cooperation. <br />
              <br />Always ready to explore and experience something new. I am
              pragmatic and down to earth, with a strong focus on what is
              happening or is very likely to happen.

              My Windows '98 computer holds a special place in my memories, as
              it marked the beginning of my digital journey and taught me
              valuable problem-solving skills. Back in those days, owning a
              Windows '98 computer was an exciting experience for me. One of the
              most memorable aspects of my Windows '98 computer was its
              reliabilityâ€”or sometimes, lack thereof. Computers of that era
              weren't as stable as modern ones, and they often encountered
              issues. But with each hiccup or glitch, I learned to tackle
              problems head-on. I quickly discovered that calling a technician
              could be costly, so I took matters into my own hands. Watching
              those technicians work became a valuable learning experience for
              me. I observed their every move, trying to grasp the intricacies
              of the machine. Over time, I became more confident and adept at
              solving issues myself. This newfound skill not only saved me money
              but also empowered me to navigate the digital world with greater
              ease.
