            My Windows '98 computer holds a special place in my memories, as it
            marked the beginning of my digital journey and taught me valuable
            problem-solving skills. Back in those days, owning a Windows '98
            computer was an exciting experience for me. One of the most
            memorable aspects of my Windows '98 computer was its reliabilityâ€”or
            sometimes, lack thereof. Computers of that era weren't as stable as
            modern ones, and they often encountered issues. But with each hiccup
            or glitch, I learned to tackle problems head-on. I quickly
            discovered that calling a technician could be costly, so I took
            matters into my own hands. Watching those technicians work became a
            valuable learning experience for me. I observed their every move,
            trying to grasp the intricacies of the machine. Over time, I became
            more confident and adept at solving issues myself. This newfound
            skill not only saved me money but also empowered me to navigate the
            digital world with greater ease.
