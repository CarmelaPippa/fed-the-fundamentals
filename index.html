          My Windows '98 computer holds a special place in my memories, as it
          marked the beginning of my digital journey and taught me valuable
          problem-solving skills. Back in those days, owning a Windows '98
          computer was an exciting experience for me.One of the most memorable
          aspects of my Windows '98 computer was its reliabilityâ€”or sometimes,
          lack thereof.

          Computers of that era weren't as stable as modern ones, and they often
          encountered issues. But with each hiccup or glitch, I learned to
          tackle problems head-on. I quickly discovered that calling a
          technician could be costly, so I took matters into my own hands.

          Watching those technicians work became a valuable learning experience
          for me. I observed their every move, trying to grasp the intricacies
          of the machine. Over time, I became more confident and adept at
          solving issues myself. This newfound skill not only saved me money but
          also empowered me to navigate the digital world with greater ease.
